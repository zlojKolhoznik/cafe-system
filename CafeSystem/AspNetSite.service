# Use your username to keep things simple, for production scenario's I recommend a dedicated user/group.
# If you pick a different user, make sure dotnet and all permissions are set correctly to run the app.
# To update permissions, use 'chown yourusername -R /srv/AspNetSite' to take ownership of the folder and files,
#       Use 'chmod +x /srv/AspNetSite/AspNetSite' to allow execution of the executable file.
